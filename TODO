Please
* Handle non-string values, conform to facter.json schema
* Normalize value and to_json to both return json?
* virtual
* abstract out command execution method
* Add regex support (e.g. for os and processor file parsing)

Not sure
* Split out into app, core lib, libs per functional group (network, storage, selinux, processors, etc)
* Use dynamic loading of libs (dlopen, etc)
* is 'weight' needed?
* fact dependencies?
