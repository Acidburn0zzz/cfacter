* Add regex support (e.g. for os and processor file parsing)
* Allow 'facter <factname>' (currently returns all facts) -- still *retrieve* all facts but only return the one? or introspect what's available?
* Split out into app, core lib, libs per functional group (network, storage, selinux, processors, etc)
* Use dynamic loading of libs (dlopen, etc)
* autoconf build
* is 'weight' needed or is there a better way?
* virtual
* fact dependencies
